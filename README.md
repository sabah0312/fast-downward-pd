# Fast Downward with Plan Deordering and Decomposing

This repository extends the [Fast Downward](https://github.com/aibasel/downward) planning system with a module (`decompose`) that transforms such plans into partial-order plans by eliminating unnecessary constraints.

The **decompose** module incorporates postprocessing techniques that take a total-order (sequential) plan and generate a partial-order plan (POP) using **EOG-based deordering** [1]. Then further minimize the orderings of the POP using **Block-deordering** [2-3].

We also incorporate a new concept, block-substitution, that facilitates substituting subplans (i.e., blocks) in a BDPO plan with action sets outside of the plan. Which is then used in **Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution (FIBS)* to minimize ordering constraints.
- **Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution (FIBS)** [5]
- **Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitution (CIBS)** [4]
- 
We also incorporate other features such as **Plan Reduction**, which eliminates redundant actions from a plan using Forward Justification or Backward Justification.

## üîç Overview

In classical planning, most planners output total-order (sequential) plans. This project introduces a module (`decompose`) that transforms such plans into partial-order plans by eliminating unnecessary orderings. The approach supports various deordering/reordering strategies, including *EOG (Explanation-based Order Generalization)* and *Block Deordering*.

- **EOG (Explanation-based Order Generalization)**: Eliminates orderings based on causal links and interference.
- **Block Deordering**: Encapsulate coherent action sets (i.e., subplans) into blocks to eliminate more orderings in a partial-order plan, resulting in a hierarchically structured plan, named Block Decomposed Partial-Order (BDPO) plan.

This project incorporates a new concept, block-substitution, that facilitates substituting subplans (i.e., blocks) in a BDPO plan with action sets outside of the plan. Which is then used in **Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution (FIBS)* to minimize ordering constraints. This proje
task.
- **Block Substitution**:  Substitute blocks (i.e., subplans) in a BDPO plan with action sets outside of the plan with respect to the corresponding planning problem,
- **Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution (FIBS)**: Eliminate more orderings in a BDPO plan by exploiting blocks as candidate subplans to substitute via block-substitution.
- **Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitution (CIBS)**: Facilitate parallel execution of plan actions by incorporating non-concurrency constraints. Then, improve concurrency via block-substitution in a BDPO plan.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
The fast-downward-pd.py script supports various deordering methods to convert a sequential plan into a partial-order plan and to minimize the ordering and non-concurrency constraints in the plan
### Basic Syntax
`./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose '<method>'`

### EOG (Explanation-based Order Generalization)
`./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'eog()'`

### Block Deordering
`./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'block_deorder()'`

### FIBS (Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution)*

*Basic FIBS decomposition*

`./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs()'`

*FIBS with concurrency enabled (allows parallel execution of actions by incorporating non-concurrency constraints)* 

`./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs(concurrency=true)'`

*FIBS with plan reduction*

./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs(plan_reduction=FJ)'

# Explanation of plan_reduction Options
The plan_reduction parameter specifies which plan reduction algorithm will be used:

|Value      |	Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
|BJ         |	Backward Justification|
|FJ         |	Forward Justification |
|NOREDUCTION| No plan reduction     |

### CIBS (Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitution)

`./fast-downward-pd.py domain.pddl instance-1.pddl sas_plan.1.lama --decompose 'cibs()'`

CIBS also allows plan reduction

## Scientific experiments

We recommend to use the [latest release](https://github.com/aibasel/downward/releases/latest) instead of the tip of the main branch.
The [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package helps running Fast Downward experiments.
Our separate [benchmark repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks) contains a collection of planning tasks.

## Supported software versions

The planner is mainly developed under Linux; and all of its features should work with no restrictions under this platform.
The planner should compile and run correctly on macOS, but we cannot guarantee that it works as well as under Linux.
The same comment applies for Windows, where additionally some diagnostic features (e.g., reporting peak memory usage when the planner is terminated by a signal) are not supported.
Setting time and memory limits and running portfolios is not supported under Windows either.

This version of Fast Downward has been tested with the following software versions:

| OS           | Python | C++ compiler                                                     | CMake |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | 3.10   | GCC 14, Clang 18                                                 | 3.30  |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | 3.10   | GCC 12, Clang 15                                                 | 3.30  |
| macOS 14     | 3.10   | AppleClang 15                                                    | 3.30  |
| macOS 13     | 3.10   | AppleClang 15                                                    | 3.30  |
| Windows 10   | 3.8    | Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 (MSVC 19.29) and 2022 (MSVC 19.41) | 3.30  |

We test LP support with CPLEX 22.1.1 and SoPlex 7.1.1. On Ubuntu we
test both CPLEX and SoPlex. On Windows we currently only test CPLEX,
and on macOS we do not test LP solvers (yet).

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
