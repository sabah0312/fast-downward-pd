This repository extends the [Fast Downward](https://github.com/aibasel/downward) planning system with a module `decompose` that facilitates various plan deordering and decomposition strategies.

The **decompose** module incorporates postprocessing techniques that take a total-order (sequential) plan and generate a partial-order plan (POP) using **EOG-based deordering** `(Kambhampati and Kedar, 1994)`. Then further minimize the orderings of the POP using **Block-deordering** `(Siddiqui and Haslum, 2012; Noor and Siddiqui, 2024a)`. *Block Deordering* encapsulates coherent action sets (i.e., subplans) into blocks to eliminate more orderings in a partial-order plan, resulting in a hierarchically structured plan, known as the *Block Decomposed Partial-Order (BDPO)* plan.

In this `decompose` module, we include the concept **block-substitution** `(Noor and Siddiqui, 2024b)`, which facilitates substituting subplans (i.e., blocks) in a BDPO plan with action sets outside of the plan for the corresponding planning problem. We also incorporate *non-concurrency constraints* in POPs to facilitate the parallel execution of actions within a plan.  

This module includes two methods **FIBS (Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution)** `(Noor and Siddiqui, 2024b)` and **CIBS (Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitutio)** `(Noor and Siddiqui, 2025)` that uses *block-substitution* to improve flexibility and concurrency of a BDPO plan, respectively.

We also include other features such as **Plan Reduction**, which eliminates redundant actions from a plan using Forward Justification or Backward Justification.

## üîç Overview

- **EOG (Explanation-based Order Generalization)**: Transforms sequential plans into partial-order plans by eliminating unnecessary orderings.
- **Block Deordering**: Encapsulate coherent action sets (i.e., subplans) into blocks to eliminate more orderings in a partial-order plan, resulting in a Block Decomposed Partial-Order (BDPO) plan.
- **Block Substitution**:  Substitute blocks (i.e., subplans) in a BDPO plan with action sets outside of the plan with respect to the corresponding planning problem,
- **Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution (FIBS)**: Eliminate orderings in a BDPO plan by exploiting blocks as candidate subplans to substitute via block-substitution.
- **Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitution (CIBS)**: Facilitate `concurrency` (parallel execution of actions) by incorporating non-concurrency constraints, and  improve concurrency via block-substitution in a BDPO plan.
- **Plan Reduction**: eliminates redundant actions from a plan using Forward Justification or Backward Justification.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
The fast-downward-pd.py script supports various deordering methods to convert a sequential plan into a partial-order plan and to minimize the ordering and non-concurrency constraints in the plan
#### Basic Syntax
```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose '<method>'
```

#### EOG (Explanation-based Order Generalization)
```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'eog()'
```

#### Block Deordering
```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'block_deorder()'
```

#### FIBS (Flexibility Improvement via Block-Substitution)

*Basic FIBS decomposition*

```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs()'
```

*FIBS with concurrency enabled (allows parallel execution of actions by incorporating non-concurrency constraints)* 

```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs(concurrency=true)'
```

*FIBS with plan reduction*

```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl> <sequential_plan> --decompose 'fibs(plan_reduction=FJ)'
```

#### Explanation of plan_reduction Options
The plan_reduction parameter specifies which plan reduction algorithm will be used:

|Value      |	Description           |
|-----------|-----------------------|
|BJ         |	Backward Justification|
|FJ         |	Forward Justification |
|NOREDUCTION| No plan reduction     |

#### CIBS (Concurrency Improvement via Block-Substitution)

```bash
./fast-downward-pd.py domain.pddl instance-1.pddl sas_plan.1.lama --decompose 'cibs()'
```

CIBS also allows plan reduction

## Compilation

To build, from the top-level directory, run:

```bash
./build.py
```

This creates the default build `release` in the directory `builds`. For information on alternative builds (e.g. `debug`) and further options, call
`./build.py --help`. 
For more information, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

# Fast Downward

Fast Downward is a domain-independent classical planning system.

## Scientific experiments

We recommend to use the [latest release](https://github.com/aibasel/downward/releases/latest) instead of the tip of the main branch.
The [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package helps running Fast Downward experiments.
Our separate [benchmark repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks) contains a collection of planning tasks.

## Supported software versions

The planner is mainly developed under Linux; and all of its features should work with no restrictions under this platform.
The planner should compile and run correctly on macOS, but we cannot guarantee that it works as well as under Linux.
The same comment applies for Windows, where additionally some diagnostic features (e.g., reporting peak memory usage when the planner is terminated by a signal) are not supported.
Setting time and memory limits and running portfolios is not supported under Windows either.

This version of Fast Downward has been tested with the following software versions:

| OS           | Python | C++ compiler                                                     | CMake |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | 3.10   | GCC 14, Clang 18                                                 | 3.30  |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | 3.10   | GCC 12, Clang 15                                                 | 3.30  |
| macOS 14     | 3.10   | AppleClang 15                                                    | 3.30  |
| macOS 13     | 3.10   | AppleClang 15                                                    | 3.30  |
| Windows 10   | 3.8    | Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 (MSVC 19.29) and 2022 (MSVC 19.41) | 3.30  |

We test LP support with CPLEX 22.1.1 and SoPlex 7.1.1. On Ubuntu we
test both CPLEX and SoPlex. On Windows we currently only test CPLEX,
and on macOS we do not test LP solvers (yet).

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates
code and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi R√∂ger and Silvia Richter.
